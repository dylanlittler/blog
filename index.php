<p>I'm a coder with a background in linguistics, teaching myself C, C++ and Python. I have a strong interest in the interface between software and hardware, studying the interaction between source code, assembly, machine code and the processor. This blog is written in PHP from scratch. I am working on implementing object-oriented PDO code to serve the pages dynamically from a MySQL database. I develop this siteon my local machine, running Gentoo Linux with a LAMP stack, and then I push it to my webhost using Git, with the odd SSH connection to configure the machine.</p>
  <p>I am more comfortable working on the command line than using a graphical interface like cPanel or PHPMyAdmin. With that in mind, I write my posts in a command line editor, currently Emacs, though I'm switching over to Vim due to its universality and its lighter overhead. I interact with MariaDB, my development server through the command line using SQL commands.</p>
  <p>I intend to make this site more responsive in the near future so that it displays better on screens with high resolution, as well as on mobile devices. I also intend to implement all the dynamic PHP code myself, and I have written the HTML and CSS from scratch. While this may seem like a pointless exercise, reinventing the wheel when tools like WordPress and Bootstrap are available, it has taught me a tremendous amount about development, and prevented me from taking basic functionality in a webpage for granted. It's harder to blame the tools I am using for problems when they are doing only what I have told them to.</p>
  <p>In this blog I will be writing about the development process behind my projects, especially the ones in C. You can follow along by viewing the source code on my <a href="https://github.com/dylanlittler/">Github repos</a>. If you have any questions, or you'd like me to clarify aspects of my code, you can email me at codinglinguist@codinglinguist.com. I hope you enjoy the <a href="/blog/bloghome.php">blog</a>.<p></p>
